# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-with-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck
**Features**

Uses Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dense layers

Preprocessing and normalization of input images

Model evaluation with training and validation accuracy plots

**Dataset**

CIFAR-10: 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes with 6,000 images per class.

50,000 training images

10,000 test images

**Requirements**

TensorFlow

Matplotlib

**Usage**

pip install tensorflow matplotlib
python cifar10_cnn.py

**Results**

Achieves around 70-75% validation accuracy after 10 epochs

Accuracy and loss curves are plotted for visual evaluation
